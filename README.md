# DB-project
University project in order to implement a database to manage an insurance society
In this project I used:

* PHP
* HTML
* CSS
* SQL

Entities and associations were modeled in SQL to provide a structure for the data to be used.
PHP has been used to make the database communicate with the website in order to provide a graphical interface (written in HTML and CSS).
This site provides the management of insurance portfolios allowing the creation of insurance policies by agents, producers and sub-agents who have different functionalities.
